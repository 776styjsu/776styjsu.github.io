# Tian Yu's PhD Website

This is the personal (primarily academic) website of Tian Yu.  
It contains information about his research, publications, and other academic activities.  
There is also a "secret" (not really hidden) page with miscellaneous content.

If you’re interested in using this template, see the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section below.

## Quick Start
- Edit `index.html` (name, email, blurb, links).
- Replace files in `assets/` (`headshot.jpg`, `Name_CV.pdf`, `og-card.png`).
- Update the JSON files in `data/` for publications, highlights, teaching, and projects.
- *(Optional)* Adjust colors in `style.css` and tweak the layout.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a repository (e.g., `username.github.io`).
2. Add these files, commit, and push to `main`.
3. In **Repository Settings → Pages**, set the source to `main` (or `/docs` if you relocate the files).
4. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io`.

## Netlify (Alternative)
Drag and drop the project folder into [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) and it will deploy automatically.
