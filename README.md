# Personal PhD Website (Starter)

A clean, accessible, single-page academic website for a PhD student.

## Quick start
- Edit `index.html` text (name, email, blurb, links).
- Replace files in `assets/` (headshot.jpg, Tian_Yu_CV.pdf, og-card.png).
- Update JSON in `data/` for publications, highlights, teaching, projects.
- Optional: change colors in `style.css` and tweak layout.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a repo (e.g., `tianyu.github.io`).
2. Add these files, commit, and push to `main`.
3. In Repo Settings â†’ Pages, set source to `main` (or `/docs` if you move files).
4. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io`.

## Netlify (alternative)
Drag-and-drop the folder at https://app.netlify.com/drop and it will deploy.
