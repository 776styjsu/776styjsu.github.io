I'm a PhD student in [Computer Science @ UVA](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science), advised by [Sebastian Elbaum](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~se4ja/). I work on **program analysis** and **automated testing** for AI/robotic systems.

Previously, I worked with [Michael D. Ernst](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/) at [UW](https://www.washington.edu/) on automated unit test generation.

## 🔬 Research Interests

My research aims to make software that interacts with the physical world **verifiable** and **reliable**.

Broadly, I explore:
1. Testing and verification methods for CPS safety and robustness
2. Applying and extending program analysis techniques to CPS and AI/ML-enabled systems
3. Automated testing, test oracles, and metrics for correctness, performance, and safety
4. Bridging the gap between simulation and real-world deployment in robotics
