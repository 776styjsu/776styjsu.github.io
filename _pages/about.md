I'm a PhD student in [Computer Science @ UVA](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science), advised by [Sebastian Elbaum](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~se4ja/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Software Engineering and Autonomous Systems, with a focus on the safety, interpretability, and robustness of AI/robotic systems.

Previously, I was fortunate to work with [Michael D. Ernst](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/) at [UW](https://www.washington.edu/) on improving automated unit test generation using program analysis.

### Frame-to-Frame Attribution Instability
**2025 • Rotation Project**

Studied how saliency maps (visual explanations) in self-driving AI change over time. Found that these explanations can flicker erratically even when the car drives smoothly—revealing a gap between what the AI "sees" and how it actually performs.
